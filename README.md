Simple Django Auth Sys

In order to load this project, you must have Django INSTALLED!
This is simple Authentication system written in Django.I used
build-in authentication forms which i rewrote, the way i wanted.
In this app you can:
- create new account
- login new account
- change your password while logged in
- recover your password, by sending you an email.
The front-end is a bit simple,but i can be rewritten to look better!
There is maybe one or two weaknesses which have to be removed in order to work better!
The email part is made only for develepment server, because it practically sends the email
in the console. In order to work the way it normally works, it should be considered 
rewriting the settings.py file.
